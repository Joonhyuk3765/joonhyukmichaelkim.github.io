abstract: This paper examines the impact of higher seeding on game outcomes in the KBO League postseason. Using data from all postseason games between 1989 and 2024 – excluding the 1999 and 2000 seasons – this study finds that higher seeding increases the probability of winning in the first stage (Wild Card) and the last stage (Korean Series). In the same stages, higher-seeded teams also tend to win by larger margins, with the estimated seeding effect being approximately three runs. Given that the majority of postseason games are decided by a margin of three runs or fewer, the estimated seeding effect suggests that it can materially affect not only individual game outcomes but also ultimately determine the postseason winner.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper finds that higher-seeded teams in the KBO postseason—especially in the Wild Card and Korean Series—are more likely to win and do so by wider margins. Given that most games are decided by three runs or fewer, the estimated seeding effect of about three runs may significantly shape postseason outcomes.
