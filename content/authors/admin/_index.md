## About Me

I am a PhD student in Economics at <a href="http://econ.korea.ac.kr/econ/" target="_blank">Korea University</a>, specialising in applied microeconomics. My primary research interests lie in studying the impacts of public programmes on labour market outcomes and health status.

I am also a full-time researcher at the <a href="https://www.kipf.re.kr/kor/" target="_blank">Korea Institute of Public Finance (KIPF)</a> in South Korea.
